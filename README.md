# Gatsby Docker

A simple Gatsby starter site wrapped in Docker to make local development easy.


Please Note: You will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed for this to work.


## Get started
1. Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:brylok/etsy-keywords.git`
2. Enter the project folder `cd gatsby-docker`
3. Launch the app: `docker-compose up` (this will take a few minutes to run the first time)
4. Visit the running app at: http://localhost:8888
